# ConsoleChessGame
Chess game and (simple) engine implemented from scratch.

This was my first attempt at creating a chess engine and my first larger project in c++. Though the engine is not very powerful or efficient, it was important to me to make it from scratch. I came up with the logic myself, which means that intuition was preferred over efficiency.
There are certain elements that I looked up and did add later on (e.g. Zobrist hashing, more efficient tree searching), but the point was to have fun and see if I could make it work!
